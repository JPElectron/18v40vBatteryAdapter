Confirmed NOT working or NOT advisable....

   - RY404010VNM = Blower 730 CFM, 190 MPH Whisper Series (Brushless) (also sold as RY404100*)
       ...this model has been observed drawing too much amperage, resulting in melted contacts

   - RYi1802BT or RYi1802B6 = 1800-Watt Portable Battery Power Station Inverter Generator
       ...because it cannot communicate with the battery pack extra pins, it does not recognize the battery at all
       ...instead get RYi818BT or RYi818BG to use your 18v batteries

Safety reminder...

Never try to charge two Ryobi Li-Ion batteries in series or parallel (this means no putting any dual adapter in a 18v or 40v charger) as damage to the internal Battery Management System (BMS) or the charger is possible. The charger cannot communicate with the battery pack extra pins to get temperature or charge current, without this info the charger may assume the wrong data and create a fire hazard, so always charge batteries individually and in approved chargers.  Genuine Ryobi chargers appear to do the right thing and not even attempt to charge, but 3rd party/aftermarket chargers may not be as smart.

I admit I am overly paranoid about charging Lithium-ion batteries: I only charge when I am at home, I only charge within the house (a temperature controlled environment) and never a garage or shed (subject to extream heat or cold). I have the charger plugged into a z-wave smart outlet: If I ever leave (my phone un-associates from the house WiFi) the z-wave outlet will turn off power to the charger, A smoke detector is positioned directly above the charger, If the smoke detector goes into alarm then the z-wave outlet will turn off power to the charger. You too should strongly consider that charging unattended or in extreme temperatures is unnessesary risk, stay safe out there.
