Safety reminder...

Never try to charge two 18v Ryobi Li-Ion batteries in series (such as putting this adapter in a 40v charger) as damage to the internal Battery Management System (BMS) or the charger is possible. The charger cannot communicate with the battery pack(s) extra pin(s) to get temperature or charge current, without this info the charger may assume the wrong data and create a fire hazard, so always charge the 18v batteries individually and in approved chargers.

Any dual 18v adapter will NOT work in the 40v inverter/generator RYi1802B6/BT, instead get RYI818BT to use your 18v batteries.
